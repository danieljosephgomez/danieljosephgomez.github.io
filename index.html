              <p>I am Head of Multiomics Structural Biology and Network Physiology Division at GomeBio. We are building out this division/department in the direction of a functional Neuro-Spatial Multi-Omics Structural Biology (NSMOSB) unit.
                
                I am also a Molecular and ML Research Scientist and Biomedical AI Engineer at <a href="https://gomera.io">Gomera Research</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area">Bay Area</a>, where I work on quantum computational immunology and machine learning.
                 
                I am doing my first masters at <a href="https://www.csueastbay.edu/">Cal State East Bay (CSUEB)</a> in Biological Sciences with a concentration in Virophysics and Structural Molecular Biology. You can read more about this in my <a href="https://gomez.ai/about/">About</a> page.
                I'm planning on doing a second masters in Molecular Science and Software Engineering (<a href="https://msse.berkeley.edu">MSSE</a>) at UC Berkeley or a MS in Neuroimaging and Informatics <a href="https://niin.usc.edu/">(NIIN)</a> at <a href="https://usc.edu">USC</a>.
                In the future, I will be working to complete a PhD in Physical Biology, Bioinformatics: Biological and Medical Informatics (BMI), or Structural, Computational Biology and Neurophysics/Biophysics. 
                <br><br>
                My undergraduate school research at <a href="https://jabsom.hawaii.edu">JABSOM, UH Mānoa</a>, was with <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/tropicalmedicine/?page_id=665">Dr. Bruce Shiramizu</a> and <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/tropicalmedicine/?page_id=473">Vivek Nerurkar</a> who were also my professors in Neurovirology. I designed experiments 
                that were funded by university grants (<a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/urop/">UROP</a>) to examine the proteomics (by Luminex) of the CSF of HAND patients and the transcriptomics (RNA ISH experiments) of necropsy brain tissue for a proof-of-concept study. After doing functional immunoassays, 
                I volunteered in <a href="https://cardiacneuroprotection.com/">Hemal Patel</a>'s Cardiac & Neuro Protection Laboratories at the <a href="https://medschool.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx">UCSD School of Medicine</a> in the VA Healthcare Hospital. 
                I won an award to join the <a href="https://education.scripps.edu/undergraduate/events-virtual-seminars-and-resources/diverge/">DiVERGE Program Cohort 2020</a>, which allowed me to arrive at <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/">UF</a> and join <a href="http://www.vulpelab.net/">Dr. Chris Vulpe</a>'s Toxicology Lab in the <a href="https://physio.vetmed.ufl.edu/">Deaprtment of Physiological Sciences</a>. 
                I was able to assist in research with a PhD candidate who had projects in high-throughput toxicity models, mitotoxicity (Mitotox), and metabolomics. At this point, I worked with 
                I was able to complete my undergraduate classes in biology. Towards the end of my degree I was hired by <a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/xinchen">Dr. Xin</a><a href="https://www.uhcancercenter.org/chen-xin"> Chen</a> in the <a href="https://bts.ucsf.edu/">Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences</a> at <a href="">UCSF</a> to move her lab to the <a href="https://www.uhcancercenter.org/">University of Hawaii Cancer Center</a>. 
                I began to gain a deep appreciation for the impact that cancer researchers are making in the community locally and globally. Since my first mentor was a Pediatric Oncologist, I always circled back to cancer research. In fact, my first publication's main focus was combining my intial expertise neurovirology and oncogenic viruses. This co-infection and cancer publication has been well received by the scientific community 
                as this review paper has been cited four times as of March 2023. One citation was for a PhD student to obtain their doctorate degree in their dissertation. Other articles are building on our research to tell a story about microbes and their impact on cancer. 
                Finishing my degree, I took classes in Cancer Biology, Genetics, Honors Genetics, Biochemistry I & II, General Virology, Physics, and Experiments in Cell and Molecular Biology that prepared me for graduate studies.
                I received my <a href="https://www.parchment.com/u/award/9fd083fdc52c0fbd34814acfc02a48fe">Bachelor of Science in Molecuar Cell Biology</a> from <a href="https://sfsu.edu">SFSU</a>,<strong> Class of 2022</strong>, where I conducted research with <a href="https://biology.sfsu.edu/faculty/roy">Scott Roy</a> and <a href=https://nicolesalazarlab.com/">Nicole Salazar</a>. This research with Dr. Salazar was successful and she continues to study chemokines in cancer.
                Since getting my degree, I instantly aligned with the largest biotechnology company in the world <a href="">Roche Diagnostics</a>. I was working in Department of Antibody Formulations of Roche Tissue Diagnostics (RTD). I desired to do my own research and joined an active research lab at <a href="">Drexel University College of Medicine</a> in the
                <a href="">Department of Microbiology & Immunology</a>. We focused on dendritic cells (DCs) and then explored neurological infections which I had been researching for a decade at this point. I co-first authored this publication previously mentioned in co-infection and cancer. I continued to write in 
                cancer as I got started in my MS program at CSUEB. I continue to write, take graduate classes, and review and edit research publications in the scientific and medical community. I have been invited to speak and give presentations in conferences around the world. 
              </p>
              <p>
                At GomeBio, I am building out a biotechnology company that will benefit customers ready to discover their story by learning how to teach their brain and immune system to fight disease. 
                <br>
                At Gomera where we identify cures, advance diagnostics, and deliver effective therapeutics to attenuate the global death toll from life-threating diseases/conditions. To do this, I am the Head of R&D Department and Translational Medicine, I am expanding a division in Neuro-Spatial Multi-Omics Structural Biology (NSMOSB). 
                I am also overseeing the development of the Gomera App, AI-assistance for robotic surgery, Surgical Data Science, and oversee the direction of the company as a whole.
